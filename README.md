# Welcome to my Neovim config!

This config was built with Neovim 0.8.0

## Steps to run:

1. Install neovim, ripgrep, and lazygit (Follow the instructions on respective GitHub repos)

- neovim: `https://github.com/neovim/neovim`
- ripgrep: `https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep`
- lazygit: `https://github.com/jesseduffield/lazygit`

2. Run `git clone https://github.com/NathanYik/nvim ~/.config/nvim`
3. Hopefully run `nvim` and it'll work? Maybe?

Don't expect flawless execution, this is still a WIP.
